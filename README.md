### Environment variables 

Remember if we give out our private key whoever has our private key <br>

owns our fund <br>

We don't want to hard code our private keys into our code <br>

just in case we accidentally we share code with someody <br>

Then the solution of above is creating .env file <br>

or environment variable <br>

we create a .env file that gonna contain sensitive information <br>
