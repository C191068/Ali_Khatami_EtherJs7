### Environment variables 

Remember if we give out our private key whoever has our private key <br>

owns our fund <br>

We don't want to hard code our private keys into our code <br>

just in case we accidentally we share code with someody <br>

Then the solution of above is creating .env file <br>

or environment variable <br>

we create a .env file that gonna contain sensitive information <br>

This sis gonna bethe file that we never gonna share with anybody <br>

This file gonna stick variables of our choosing to our environment varibales <br>

here the below code :

```
$env:HUMAN = "Khatami"
```

```
echo $env:HUMAN
```


This is what an environent variable is <br>

It sis a variable in our terminal or scripting environment <br>
